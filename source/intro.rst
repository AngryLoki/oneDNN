LLGA (Low Level Graph API) is a graph API as oneAPI extension to optimize deep learning (DL) applications.
oneAPI is single, unified programming model that aims to simplify development across multiple
architectures - such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and accelerators. For the DL application development,
oneAPI include Data Paraller C++ language and specification for primitive API for deep learning
compute and communcation operations. Intel's implementation of oneAPI include DPC++ compiler and
libraries, oneDNN and oneCCL.
