Data Model

oneDNN Graph uses *logical tensor* to describe data type, shape, and layout. The
data type could be fp32, int8, bf16, fp16, and future extension. The shape
contains multiple dimensions, and the total dimension and the size of dimension
could be set as unknown.

oneDNN Graph supports both public layout and opaque layout. When the
|lt_layout_type| of logical tensor is |lt_strided_layout|, it means that the
tensor layout is public which the user can identify each tensor element in the
physical memory. For example, for :math:`dims[][][] = {x, y, z}`,
:math:`strides[][][] = {s0, s1, s2}`, the physical memory location should be in
:math:`s0*x+s1*y+s2*z`.

When the |lt_layout_type| of logical tensor is |lt_opaque_layout|, users are not
supposed to interpret the memory buffer directly. A |lt_opaque_layout| tensor
can only be output from oneDNN Graphâ€™s *compiled partition* and can only be fed
to another compile partition as input tensor.
